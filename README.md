# coding-grimoire
A Cookbook storing coding recipes as I go on my coding adventure.

I found the programming Cookbook Method after buying a Humble Bundle of coding language Cookbooks and looking into what they actually were. I found the [Dev_Dungeon](https://www.devdungeon.com/cookbook) and loved the suggestion of making my own.

"The Cookbook Method is the process of learning a programming language by building up a repository of small programs that implement specific programming concepts."

## Procedure
* Build small programs that only accomplish a single task / topic. 
* Start with programs that accomplish simple tasks then work your way up to more complicated ones.
* Does not need to just be code. Text file How To's on programming tasks, complicated instructions, or how to run specific technologies are good ideas of things to include.
* Include templates / skeletons / bases for programs that would be helpful to have for the future.
* Make sure each program can be run and isn't just a broken code snippet. 
* Comments, Notes, Annotations!
