# Coding Grimoire
A Grimoire for storing programming concepts as I go on my coding adventure.

I found the programming Cookbook Method after buying a Humble Bundle of coding language Cookbooks and looking into what they actually were. It led me to the [Dev_Dungeon](https://www.devdungeon.com/cookbook) and I realized after reading it over that I had already been doing this for a few years off and on in a OneNote notebook. What better way to practice version control and actually coding out these examples (that were just images in the OneNote) than to do it on GitHub? I'm going to use this opportunity to build my programming knowledge and coding skills for now and the future.

## Procedure
* Build small programs that only accomplish a single task / topic. 
* Start with programs that accomplish simple tasks then work your way up to more complicated ones.
* Does not need to just be code. Text file How To's on programming tasks, complicated instructions, or how to run specific technologies are good ideas of things to include.
* Include templates / skeletons / bases for programs that would be helpful to have for the future.
* Make sure each program can be run and isn't just a broken code snippet. 
* Comments, Notes, Annotations!
